        <h3>Description</h3>

        <p>These cheesy zucchini pizza bites are an excellent replacement
             for pizza without the carbs â€” you won't even miss the crust! 
             Season with your favorite herbs.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>

        <ul>
            <li>2 zucchini, sliced into 1/4-inch thick rounds</li>
            <li>1/4 cup pizza sauce, or more to taste</li>
            <li>20 slices pepperoni, or more to taste</li>
            <li>1/2 cup shredded mozzarella cheese, or as needed</li>
            <li>Italian seasoning, dried parsley, or oregano for 
                sprinkling (Optional)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Steps</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). 
                Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Spread zucchini slices in 1 layer on the prepared 
                baking sheet.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until zucchini is tender, 
                about 15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Spoon pizza sauce over each zucchini slice and top with 
                pepperoni and mozzarella cheese. Sprinkle herbs over each.</li>
            <li>Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted, about 
                5 minutes more.</li>
        </ol>
